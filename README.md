# IoT-Hub
Final year project

The IOTHub project is a comprehensive IoT device management platform developed with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. Here's how it's built across its various components:

# Front-End:
Framework: The front-end is crafted using React combined with Bootstrap for the design. React's component-based structure allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Bootstrap ensures the UI is clean, modern, and mobile-friendly.
UI/UX: The interface is designed to be intuitive, providing real-time updates and controls for connected IoT devices. Bootstrap's extensive library of components and utilities helps in quickly assembling a polished and consistent look across the platform.

# Back-End:
Technology Stack: The back-end is powered by Django, a powerful Python web framework. Django’s built-in features for handling API requests, authentication, and session management make it ideal for this project.
API Management: Django REST Framework is employed to create RESTful APIs, facilitating smooth communication between the front-end and the back-end. This allows for efficient data handling and secure interactions with the IoT devices.

# Database:
Database Management System (DBMS): SQLite is used as the database for this project. SQLite is lightweight and serverless, making it a good fit for development environments and applications with moderate data storage needs.
Data Models: The database is designed to store information on IoT devices, user credentials, logs, and real-time data streams. Django’s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is used to manage these data models, ensuring seamless data operations and integrity.

This stack ensures that the IOTHub project is scalable, maintainable, and provides a seamless experience for managing IoT devices.
